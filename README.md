### Environment Variables

The frontend comes with a pre-configured `.env` file:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The frontend connects to the backend API at this URL. For production deployment, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the deployed backend URL via `--build-arg` in Docker or via your CI/CD environment.

### Running with the Backend

The frontend requires the backend server to be running. See the **Full-Stack Local Development** section in this README for complete setup instructions.
